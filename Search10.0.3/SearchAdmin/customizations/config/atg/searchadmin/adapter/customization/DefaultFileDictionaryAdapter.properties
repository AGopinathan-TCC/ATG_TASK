# dictionaryItems is a map of a dictionary id (also used as the display name for the file-based adapter)
# and the file path to the dictionary xml files.
# For example, the following example would look for a my-english-dictionary.xml file 
# at /atg/searchadmin/adapter/customization/ relative to the root of the VFS system.
# The default VFS for this adapter is a LocalFileSystem with the <ATG_INSTALL>/home as the root.
