# This bean is used to initialize the admin account database.  You may
# disable this feature by either setting the "enabled" property to false
# or removing the initializer from the AdminUserAuthority settings.  You
# should do this after all of the standard accounts have been properly
# created so that they are not accidentally re-created if they are deleted.

# If set to false, the initializer will not do anything.

# This is the account manager that acts as the source for initialization
fromManager=SimpleXmlUserAuthority

# If true, the source passwords are plaintext and should be encrypted
# during the copy.  If false, passwords are already encrypted and
# should simply be copied.
