Let Quincy teach you how to keep your cool, even when the market is hot.<p>

During the stock market's late-summer swoon, commentators and investors alike grasped for words to best 
describe the tumultuous investing environment. They called it volatile, erratic, unpredictable, even scary.<p>

Jacob Wirth, Quincy's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, prefers a different adjective: educational.<p>

After hitting record highs on July 17, stocks embarked on a dizzying descent that dragged the overall market 
down nearly 20% in six weeks and stripped more than 40% from the value of many smaller stocks. This decline, 
following less severe downdrafts in March 1997 and October 1997, Mr. Wirth said, made for "an 18-month gut 
check" that has shown investors whether they have the risk tolerance for the market's inevitable downturns.<p>

"If you've taken a few body blows, got up, dusted yourself off, and realized you can take the market's ups and downs, then you probably have the knowledge and the perspective you need to ride out future volatility," 
Mr. Wirth said during an interview in late September. "But if all this movement has made you realize that 
you're shouldering more risk than you want, then it may be time to make some changes. "Either way, you've 
found out something important about yourself."<p>

Maintain a Balanced Approach<p>

Mr. Wirth said every investor's indispensable ally in weathering such a frenzied period is a balanced 
portfolio that is built for the long haul. "It may sound trite, but the most important thing you can do is 
to create a sound long-term plan and then stick with it," he said. "That doesn't mean that you do nothing for 
decades. It means that when you make adjustments or changes, you do so only in the context of your long-term 
goals."<p>

The mix of stocks, bonds, and cash reserves that you create to achieve those goals should be based on your 
personal objectives, time horizon, and tolerance for risk. And it should be made in light of a realistic 
expectation of what your portfolio may provide over the long run. During the 1990s, stocks have earned an 
annualized return of nearly 18%. However, the longer-term average return on stocks is about 11%, according 
to Ibbotson Associates of Chicago.<p>

"As we've seen recently, investments go down, sometimes for extended periods. So when you make return 
assumptions, you should take into account the possibility that something bad may happen for 10 years," Mr. Wirth
 said. "That's not all that uplifting, but it's certainly much more realistic than assuming that you're going 
to get above-average returns for 20 or 30 years."<p>

Tune Out the Noise<p>

Are you addicted to CNBC? Are you obsessed with news about Thailand's currency, the baht? Do you check your 
mutual funds in the newspaper every day or log on to your computer every night to peek at your portfolio? 
If so, you may have a self-inflicted case of financial information overload, Mr. Wirth said.<p>

"It's important to be a knowledgeable investor, but focusing too intently on interim movements in your 
portfolio's value is unnecessary and can be damaging," Mr. Wirth said.<p>

"You have to tune out the noise and listen to what really matters. And for long-term investors, short-term 
volatility doesn't matter."<p>

Investors who find that they need to adjust their portfolios to better reflect the risk they're willing to 
take should make gradual shifts, Mr. Wirth said. Strategies aimed at capitalizing on market volatility, 
such as market timing or "buying on the dips," rarely pay off over the long run, he said.<p>

"Buying stocks on the dips means you're selling something else or that you've been holding money on the 
sidelines timing your purchase activity," Mr. Wirth said. "No one can consistently make the right call 
on where the financial markets are headed."<p>

Mr. Wirth also cautioned against abandoning stocks during rocky periods, noting that the financial markets 
don't offer a true safe haven anywhere. Bonds carry the significant risk that interest rates will rise and 
bond values will fall. Cash reserves such as money market funds—often viewed as a risk-free alternative to 
stocks—can fall prey to a silent villain: inflation.<p>

"At times it's hard to keep your emotions in check, whether it's thinking the down times will never end or 
that the upside of investing will go on forever," Mr. Wirth said.<p>

"The best investors are those who can keep any investment environment in perspective."
