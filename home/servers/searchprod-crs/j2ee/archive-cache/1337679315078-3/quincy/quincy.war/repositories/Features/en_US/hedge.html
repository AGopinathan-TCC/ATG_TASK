With all that you've heard about Quincy's new high risk funds, you may be asking yourself, do Quincy's high 
risk Hedge Funds offer better performance? Well, the answer is yes. The Quincy Center for Investment Research 
has been studying the performance of our new funds, and we have to say that we're proud of the results.<p>
 
Conventional investment wisdom warns investors to steer clear of our new Hedge Funds and to stay with funds 
that have established track records of five years or even longer. But an investor who followed that advice 
today would be forced to ignore no fewer than 724 diversified U.S. equity funds that have been established 
during the past five years—including 90 that are less than one year old. Grouped in this newest sector of funds 
are the Quincy High Risk Hedge Funds. In fact, our Hedge Funds are among the 10 top-performing diversified 
U.S. equity mutual funds of this past year.<p>
 
Are our new Hedge Funds worthwhile—or even superior—investments? At the very least, they are among the top performing 
funds ever to exist and they definitely merit further study. This report takes a hard look at the numbers and 
provides conclusions that investors can use to make more-informed investment decisions, and clearly the wisest 
investment choice would be to buy into our High Risk Hedge Funds.
