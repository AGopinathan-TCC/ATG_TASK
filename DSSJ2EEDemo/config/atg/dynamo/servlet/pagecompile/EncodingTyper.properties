# Default encoding type for all pages not mapped by file path.
#
# The default is null which corresponds to the ASCII encoding.  This is
# treated as a special case to avoid byte -> char conversion overhead.
#
defaultEncoding=ISO-8859-1

# The next two properties are used on sites that support more than one
# type of page encoding.  If your site uses only one page encoding,
# then you are better off leaving the following two properties unset
# and just set the defaultEncoding property.

# Mapping of the Java encoding identifier to use for a series of
# identifiers that will occur in a pattern string, specifically ISO
# Language Code, ISO Country Code, Variant, and an encoding
# identifier.  The mapping is designated as follows:
#
#   Java Encoding:ISO Language:ISO Country:Variant:Encoding Identifier
#
# E.g.:
#   EUCJIS:ja:JA::EUC would indicate that when the identifiers ja, JA,
# and EUC are all found in a pattern string, then the encoding EUCJIS
# should be used.
# 
encodingMappings+=\
	Shift_JIS:ja:JP::,\
	ISO-8859-1:fr:FR::,\
	ISO-8859-1:de:DE::

# Pattern prefixes used to identify the page encoding.  They represent
# a prefix that is looked for at the beginning of URL request paths.
# The pattern strings are in Java MessageFormat pattern string format,
# e.g. /{0}/{1}/.  The pattern string argument fields map respectively
# to the identifiers used in the encodingMappings property, i.e
#
#  {0} = ISO Language Code
#  {1} = ISO Country Code
#  {2} = Variant
#  {3} = Encoding
#
# A possible pattern string for the example encodingMapping
# EUCJIS:ja:JA::EUC could be /{0}_{1}/{3}/.  (Note that the Variant
# identifier is skipped.)  URLs like
# http://foo.com/ja_JA/EUC/news/map.html would now be identified as
# being in EUCJIS.
