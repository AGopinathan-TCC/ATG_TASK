  <objective>Quincy Special Situations Fund seeks high total return through
  capital appreciation and income.
  </objective>

  <strategy>This fund pursues capital appreciation and current income by
  buying stocks with deeply-depressed prices that fund management believes
  have the potential for recovery. Fund management searches for three types
  of value stocks:  stocks with high current dividend yields, stocks
  temporarily discounted by the market, and  stocks that management
  believes are fundamentally misunderstood but have great potential. The
  depressed prices of these stocks make them more responsive to
  company-specific news than to general stock market trends.
