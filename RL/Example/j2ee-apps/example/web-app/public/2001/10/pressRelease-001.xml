This document is standard press release delivered in XML format with each definable section broken out into it's own tag. Presumably this is done to allow it to be reprocessed into other formats later at some future date. This press release isn't about anything or anyone. While it is modeled after a software industry press release it simply serves to help demonstrate some of the possible configurations supported by the Repository Loader (RL.)
