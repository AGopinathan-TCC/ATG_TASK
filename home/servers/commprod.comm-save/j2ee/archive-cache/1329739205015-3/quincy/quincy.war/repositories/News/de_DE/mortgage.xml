It may depend on how much risk you can tolerate. A traditional 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgage is still the safest way to go. Your monthly payment will
stay the same for the life of the loan. You are protected from rises in
interest rates, and if rates go lower, you can always refinance.
An adjustable rate mortgage, or ARM, is riskier but often less costly. ARMs
typically offer below-market teaser rates and then adjust according to
current interest rates as often as every few months. These loans set caps on
the interest rate and the amount it can ratchet up each period. Be careful
of loans that have payment caps because they can leave you owing more money
on your mortgage each time you make a payment if interest rates rise
quickly. ARMs are best for people who need initially lower monthly payments,
who expect their income to rise, or who expect to live in their home for
five years or less.

Mortgages with 30-year terms are still the most popular although 15-year
mortgages are gaining favor among people who want to build equity faster at a
lower cost. Many homeowners with 30-year mortgages, however, can also lower
their costs and shorten the term of their loans by paying extra each month.
