;*** NETWORK NAME ***
;Listen=<protocol> <name or port>
;
;Solid listens to the network using certain protocols and listening
;names or port numbers. Client processes must use a matching network
;name, when connecting to a server.
;The default listening names vary depending on platform.
;Solid 3.7 clients assume that the network name matches the appropriate
;name from below.  For Windows, NmPipe is the default.
;Select, edit and uncomment a suitable listening setting from below:
;Listen=tcpip 1313			; Generic
;Listen=tcpip 1313, upipe SOLID		; Unix
Listen=tcpip 1313, NmPipe SOLID	; Windows
;Listen=tcpip 1313, shmem SOLID		; Windows
;Listen=tcpip 1313, decnet SOLID	; OpenVMS
;Listen=spx SOLID			; NetWare

;*** DATABASE FILES ***
;FileSpec_1=solid.db 2000m  ;filepath & maximum size in bytes
;
;SOLID uses by default 'solid.db' as the first database file,
;with maximum size of 2 gigabytes.
;You may use m for megabytes or k for kilobytes.


;*** CACHE SIZE ***
CacheSize=8m   ; bytes
;
;Solid uses platform specific default settings for cache size, until the
;following setting is uncommented. 
;Please use multiplies of 8KB (database file block size)
;You may use m for megabytes or k for kilobytes.


[Logging]
;logenabled=no
;
;*** LOG FILES LOCATION ***
;FileNameTemplate=<log_file_path>sol#####.log
;
;Solid writes by default the log files into the directory where it is
;started. However, it is recommended to store the logfiles on a separate
;physical drive than where the database files reside. 
;Replace '<log_file_path>' above with the actual directory, where logfiles 
;should be stored. The string '#####' will be substituted with the current
;log file sequence number by SOLID when creating new log files.


[General]

;*** BACKUP LOCATION ***
;BackupDirectory=backup
;BackupDirectory=<default_backup_path>
;
;The default location for backups in this package is the backup directory
;under the working directory. Note, the backup directory can be 
;given also as parameter to administration command 'backup'.
;It is recommended to store the backups on a separate physical drive than
;where the database files reside. 
;Replace '<default_backup_path>' above with the actual directory, where 
;backup files should be stored when 'backup' is started without parameters.

;*** ROW-LEVEL LOCKING
Pessimistic=yes
; Row-level locking is required for most Dynamo tables.  Oracle, DB2,
; and MSSQL always use row-level locking.  If you do not set row-level
; locking, Dynamo reports concurrency errors.

;*** REMOVING LOG FILES AUTOMATICALLY IN DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
;CheckPointDeleteLog=Yes
;
;You may use this parameter to instruct SOLID to erase all log files
;after all data has been flushed to the database files from cache.
;
; WARNING!	This parameter should never be used in production
;		environments as this makes it impossible to recover
;		after failures to the latest committed transaction 
;		by using the latest backup and log files.

[Sorter]
;TmpDir_1=tmp
;The default location for temporary sorting files in this package is the 
;tmp directory under the working directory. 
;Note, if there are several SOLID processes running in the same server/device
;they should have separate sorter directories
