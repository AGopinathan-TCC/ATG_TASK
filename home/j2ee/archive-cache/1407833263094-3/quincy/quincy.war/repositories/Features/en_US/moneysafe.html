In an industry where worrying about high risk investments is a constant battle, Quincy's Bond Funds provide 
moderate exposure to interest rate risk and offer you the rock solid security that you deserve.<p>

Interest rate risk for the Quincy Short Term Bond Fund and the Quincy High Yield Bond Fund should be modest. 
Because of their short-term average weighted maturities, the Quincy bond fund Portfolios are expected to 
exhibit low to moderate price fluctuations as interest rates change.<p>

The Quincy Short Term Bond Fund and the Quincy High Yield Bond Fund Portfolios differ principally in terms of 
credit quality and potential yield. For the Quincy Short Term Bond Fund Portfolio, credit risk should be 
negligible. With its corporate bond holdings, the Quincy High Yield Bond Fund Portfolio offers slightly 
higher exposure to credit risk than does the Quincy Short Term Bond Fund Portfolio. However, because 
of the Portfolio's well-diversified holdings and emphasis on high-quality bonds, overall credit risk should 
still be quite low.
