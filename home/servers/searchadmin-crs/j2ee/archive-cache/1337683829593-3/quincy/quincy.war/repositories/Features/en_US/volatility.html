Qunicy Fund's chief investment strategist Scott M. Skipper issued the research report Just How Bad Is It? 
The report details Mr. Skipper's view on the recent market volatility and discusses his market forecast.<p>

Highlights of the report include the following:<p>

The issue for investors is not Asia, or Russia, or Latin America or, in fact, the sum of their problems. The 
issue for investors is the earnings that one pays for when buying U.S. equities. And the fact is that 55 
percent to 60 percent of S&P earnings are derived from the U.S. and more than 20 percent from Europe. Absent 
a U.S. and European recession, this market is inexpensive.<p>

The problem is that proving we are not headed into a recession may take a prolonged period of time without a 
recession developing. That proof may not be apparent until sometime next year - although stocks do tend to 
anticipate.<p>

It would seem that there are two possible scenarios for stock prices to resume their upward trend. The benign 
scenario is that the market starts to get more comfortable with 1999 corporate earnings, which we still think 
are likely to be up 5 percent to 10 percent. But first the market may have to deal with at least one more 
quarter of modest earnings growth.<p>

The worst case scenario for investors is that if global events continue to be threatening, it may well take 
the Federal Reserve easing interest rates to reverse the market correction. Initially, this action could be 
viewed as confirmation by the Fed that there is a problem looming - and that could spark further market 
declines. However, ultimately it would have a positive effect on the market because such easing would be 
viewed by investors as a sign that the Fed will provide liquidity to counteract the problem. In that case, 
the potent combination of lower rates and even just modestly rising earnings should move stocks to new highs 
over the next 12 to 18 months.<p>
