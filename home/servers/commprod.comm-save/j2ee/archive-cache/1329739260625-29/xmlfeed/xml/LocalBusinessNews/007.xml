  Key alliances open doors to new markets</summary>
<content>CAMBRIDGE, Mass., July 28, 2001 - Zydeco, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZYD) today said it should exceed its fiscal third-quarter earnings targets by $.02 and raised expectations for fourth-quarter earnings, news that sent its stock higher.

Shares of Zydeco jumped more than 10 percent to a high of $48 in early trade on Nasdaq following the revenue boost. Shares fell back down to $46.02, still up nearly 8 percent.

The Cambridge, Massachusetts maker of products attributed its increased revenue stream to key relationships with Geomatrix, Inc. and Phoenix, Inc.

"Being able to effectively and more efficiently do business with our two key partners has given us the capability to expand into new markets," Joyce Taylor, chief officer said. "After a solid June, we found ourselves in a stronger than anticipated position at the end of the quarter."
