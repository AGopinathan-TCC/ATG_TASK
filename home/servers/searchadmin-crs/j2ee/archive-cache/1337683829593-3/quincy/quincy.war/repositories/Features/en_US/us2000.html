With all of the hubbub about the US Economy in the year 2000, it actually appears that the biggest Year 2000 
problems will happen abroad.<p>
 
The greatest potential for Year 2000 computer problems lies outside the United States with domestic problems 
mostly confined to a handful of states and business sectors, the government said.<p>

"It now appears that a number of countries will experience Year 2000 failures in key infrastructures such as 
electric power, telecommunications, and transportation,'' White House Year 2000 coordinator John Kosherwein 
said.<p>

These failures would not hurt the U.S. economy overall but could hurt individual businesses and would 
certainly affect travelers and those working abroad, he said.<p>

Kosherwein told a news conference the government would start to identify problem states and countries by name 
as the year progressed.<p>

"We are not in the business of trying to embarrass people but on the other hand we certainly have an 
obligation to let everyone know what the status is," said the chairman of President Clinton's Council on 
Year 2000 Conversion. The Year 2000 computer problem, known as Y2K for short, arises because many older 
computers and software allocated only two digits for the year in the date.
