    The U.S. economy is poised to show slow growth over the next six to nine
     months, according to a key compilation of economic data.

      The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators held steady in
      September at 105.5, where it has been since July. With the components of the
      index already reported, September's reading was expected.
      "The leading index is still considerably higher now than last year,
      suggesting that rising consumer spending and low interest rates should keep
      us out of a recession," Michael Boldin, the board's director of business
      cycle research, said in a prepared statement.
      As in August, the stock market's decline was the major factor holding down
      the index. Five of the index's 10 components fell in September, however.
      Money supply was the most significant of the index's positive contributors.
      One component, average factory work week, was unchanged.
      The board's index of coincident indicators, which looks at the economy's
      current condition, also remained unchanged from August. The lagging
      indicators index, which looks at the past, decreased.
