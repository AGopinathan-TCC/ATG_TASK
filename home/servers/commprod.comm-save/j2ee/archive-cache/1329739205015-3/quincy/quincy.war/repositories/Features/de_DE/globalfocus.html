As the "early adopter" and quickest exploiter of many of the profound changes that have occurred in the structure of technology and financial services in recent years, 
the US has attracted the highest proportion of global investment. While there are many market commentators disparaging today's US equity markets on the basis of 
historically high price-to-earnings ratios and seemingly infinite growth assumptions, we feel this view may be too extreme. Instead, we foresee global investors 
recognizing more value in non-US equity markets as the system advantages that were once almost exclusive to the US spread to Europe and Japan, and the market 
capitalizations of these respective regions begin to more closely reflect their actual contributions to global GDP. As such, our view is that global diversification will 
regain its value as investors both enhance the quality of their portfolios and seek to reduce risk by broadening their asset allocation to include higher weightings in 
non-US equity markets such as Europe, Japan and emerging markets. (Given the current trend towards increased investor participation in global equity markets, our 
suggestions in this issue are focused on equities and "equity-like" return asset classes.)<p>

Regional Assesments<p>

US<p>
• While the overall level of inflation seems to be only marginally increasing despite a tight labor force and rising commodity prices, there is a strong bias to keep 
monetary policy tight in the US. As a prolonged period of interest rate increases is rarely beneficial to equities, we are somewhat conservative in the US in the short 
run until we can see more definitive economic balance. <p>

• We believe that since large capitalization stocks will likely remain vulnerable to the rising interest rate environment, the focus in the large cap sector should be on 
quality and earnings. Small cap stocks with solid earnings should continue to perform well.<p>

• In the technology sector, we foresee greater focus on business plan execution and delivery of bottom-line profits and we believe this will eventually slow the 
momentum in these stocks.<p>

• We would suggest at least a GDP-based market cap weighting in the US of approximately 40% in the short term and 35% over the long term.<p>

• For those seeking to invest in fixed income, we would suggest allocating approximately 25% of US exposure to short-to-intermediate duration bonds (1-5 years) over the short term. We believe high real rates of return and the  relative yield advantage of these issues will make them attractive for the first time in many years.<p>

Europe<p>
• The investment scenario is extremely bright in Europe. The introduction of the euro and the anticipated addition of several new euro countries over the next decade 
provide the backbone of economically friendly reform and competitiveness that should continue to foster growth.<p>

• A stable euro should eventually be achieved, albeit with difficulty, and while there is still much labor and political reform left to occur in the region, it is clear to us that Europe will be an area of strong equity growth.<p>

• Already merger & acquisition and restructuring activity points to the acceptance of change in Europe. In 1999, European mergers and acquisitions rose 50% to USD 1.2 trillion.<p>

• The euro area is encouraging the growth of high tech companies. New financing channels are opening up and the economic expansion is restoring the potential for increased R&D spending. New economy companies in Europe are realizing the benefits of technology faster than these companies previously have in the US.<p>

• Both our global and European strategies favor increased commitments to the region. We suggest at least a GDP-weighted allocation to Europe of approximately 30% over the short term and 35% over the long term.<p>

Japan<p>
• While Japan is another area undergoing significant change economically, it is also being transformed into a much more shareholder-oriented culture that is focused on corporate profits.<p>

• With greater influence of Western-style management ideas and new economy technology companies, we have begun to see improvement in industrial activity and the profitability of Japanese corporations.<p>

• The combination of improved corporate earnings, greater financial system liquidity and low interest rates should encourage greater equity market participation by Japanese investors.<p>

• Foreign participation in Japanese equity markets continues to increase, as multinational pension managers seek to bolster their Japan weightings to neutral from historically under-weighted positions.<p>

• We suggest increasing commitment to Japan to a GDP-weighted allocation of 20% for both the short and long term.<p>

Emerging Markets<p>
• Emerging markets have been historically viewed as a commodity or cyclical play. Our view, however, is that markets are changing and broadening with the greater 
proportion of companies issuing ADRs, the increase in the number of company sector constituents and improvement in the management of these companies.<p>

• While we would not suggest more than a 20% allocation to these markets, we do feel that at least 10% is warranted on the basis of economic growth sensitivity, 
attractive price-to-earnings and other valuation characteristics, and higher growth expectations.<p>

• Despite excellent performance in 1999, we still see solid short- and long-term prospects for emerging markets and Latin America in particular.<p>

• We would also suggest fixed-income exposure in these markets as yield spreads remain historically high and credit quality is improving.<p>
