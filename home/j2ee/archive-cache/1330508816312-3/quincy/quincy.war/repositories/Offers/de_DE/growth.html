On May 1, 2000, Quincy Funds extended its line of growth funds with <A HREF="/QuincyFunds/de/fund.jsp?ElementId=/repositories/Funds/de_DE/growth.xml">Quincy Growth Fund</a>.
<p>
<p>
The newest addition to Quincy's lineup of 17 actively managed equity funds resulted from
 the reorganization of Wombat Growth Fund into the newly formed Quincy Growth
 Fund. This tax-free reorganization was approved by shareholders of Wombat Growth
 Fund on April 1, 2000.

<p>

 Quincy Growth Fund will continue the investment objective of its predecessor: to
 seek long-term capital appreciation by investing in stocks of U.S. companies with medium
 and large capitalizations that are believed to have strong earnings growth potential and
 reasonable valuations at the time of purchase. Wombat Investment Partners will remain as the
 fund's investment adviser, joining Quincy's 12 distinguished external advisory firms that
 provide investment management services to 28 Quincy stock, bond, and balanced funds.
<p>
 Wombat Investment Partners, adviser to the WIP Funds, oversees more than $25 billion in
 stock, bond, and balanced accounts and mutual funds for institutions and individuals. The
 independent, employee-owned firm is located in Falls Church, Virginia.

 "Quincy Growth Fund broadens our choice of actively managed growth funds for
 individual and retirement plan investors. The fund is particularly suited to those investors
 seeking to add a more aggressive portfolio to a well-balanced, diversified investment
 program," said Quincy Chairman and CEO Heywood Yabozof, who noted that two of
 Quincy's six traditionally managed growth funds (QUID and QUIP) are
 closed to new investor accounts. "We are obviously delighted to welcome aboard Wanda
 About and her team, who together bring integrity, experience, depth, and a proven track
 record to the management of the fund."
