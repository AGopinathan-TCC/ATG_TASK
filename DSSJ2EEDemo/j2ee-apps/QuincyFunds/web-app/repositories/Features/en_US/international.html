So many financial advisors and newspaper columnists tout global diversification that it has begun to sound 
like a mantra. Let the experts at Quincy explain what incorporating international stocks into your 
portfolio can do for you.<p>
 
Some people may assume that geographic diversification is recommended because the two asset classes move 
inversely to one another — international stocks tend to go up when U.S. stocks are headed downward, and 
vice-versa.<p>
 
Not necessarily, says Missy Feinstein of Quincy's Center for Investment Research. "In today's world 
economy," says Feinstein, "international markets are interconnected. An event that impacts one market or group 
of markets has repercussions that carry over into others. If you look at the historical numbers, you'll see 
that more often than not, U.S. and foreign markets have tended to travel in the same direction."<p>
 
The Center's research shows that, from January 1970 through June 1998, there were 158 months during which 
prices rose both in the U.S. market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, and foreign markets, 
as measured by the Morgan Stanley Capital, Inc., Europe Asia Far East (MSCI-EAFE) Index. Over the same 
period, there were 73 months in which both indices moved downward. In other words, the two indices moved in 
the same direction for 231 of 342 months, just a little over two thirds of the time.<p>
 
So if a downward trend domestically may not be offset by an upward trend overseas, why do so many financial 
experts recommend global diversification? The answer lies in the magnitude, rather than the direction, of 
market movement. While the general tendency of the two asset classes is to move together, U.S. stocks have 
historically outperformed foreign equities during certain periods, and underperformed them during others.<p>
 
There were nine identifiable periods between 1970 and 1997 when one of the two asset classes clearly 
outperformed the other. In all but three of these periods, both domestic and international securities moved 
in the same direction. While U.S. stocks have performed better in the last few years, international stocks 
took the lead as recently as 1993-1994, and through most of the 1980s. So when you ask yourself, should I be 
afraid to invest internationally, you should ell yourself, "No, no no!"
