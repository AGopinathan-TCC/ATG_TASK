This directory contains the programmatically generated .java and .class files
that are created from .jhtml files.  The path names of the files are generated
from the absolute path names of the original jhtml file that they came from.
To ensure that these names are unique, valid package names, an '_' is prepended
onto each directory name and other special characters (such as :) are expanded
into hexadecimal representation.
