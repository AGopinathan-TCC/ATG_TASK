Quincy believes that although selling short isn't always the best advice when investing in our funds, sometimes 
it's a good instant solution to a potential long-term problem. One should always take a prudent approach when 
selling a Mutual Fund, and much to many an investor's surprise, one can often reap large benefits when one 
chooses to sell short.<p>
 
For most investors, especially those with equity exposure and long-term perspectives, buy-and-hold is the 
easiest strategy to pursue and one that has proven effective on a historical basis. What buy-and-hold really 
means is staying the course through short-term market dips. However, when individual funds fail to measure up 
to market or peer performance, you should consider selling.<p>
 
The Quincy Center for Investment Research completed a study to compare the classic buy-and-hold approach with 
a strategy of selling underperforming mutual funds on a periodic basis in an effort to achieve higher 
portfolio returns, and what our research team discovered may astonish some investors. As it turns out, 
90% of investors will achieve more financial gain by selling their less profitable mutual finds early on. 
So despite what your parents may have told you about investing, selling a goose that lays rotten gold eggs, 
may turn out to be the most profitable answer to your problems.
