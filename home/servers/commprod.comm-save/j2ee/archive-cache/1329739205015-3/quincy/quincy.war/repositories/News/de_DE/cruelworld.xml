As emerging markets across the globe toppled one by one earlier this year,
Ken Winans, a financial planner, began trumpeting a new investment message.
</p>

<p>
"Average investors don't have any business putting their money into
international markets" anymore, said Mr. Winans of Mill Valley, Calif.
"Unless ordinary investors educate themselves about international markets,
they should just leave all their assets at home."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Winans wasn't the only one spreading this credo. In Pittsburgh,
investment counselor Steve Lee was warning clients, "The picture is pretty
gloomy [for emerging markets] for the next couple of years." Mr. Lee
recommended some investors sell their emerging-markets mutual funds and book
a tax loss. For those customers who were particularly spooked by the
meltdown, he suggested they not buy back in.
</p>

<p>
Just a few years ago, such thinking would have amounted to blasphemy. At the
time, conventional wisdom dictated that overseas funds were the hot new
investment ticket. Impressed by the amazing growth that young markets such
as Malaysia and Indonesia were delivering, a hodgepodge of academics,
financial advisers and mutual-fund companies preached that non-U.S. stock
funds would reduce the risks in a mutual-fund portfolio, as well as enhance
returns.
