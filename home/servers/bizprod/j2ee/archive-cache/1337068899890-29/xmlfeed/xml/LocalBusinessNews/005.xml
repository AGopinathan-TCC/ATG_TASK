  Stocks Up As Earnings Announced</headline>
<summary>
  ROIMax and Geomatrix lead the way with their earnings announcements </summary>
<content>New York.  July 12, 2001. Stocks were up as three of Wall Street's top strategists raised their year-end profit estimates for America's biggest companies after hearing ROIMax and Geomatrix earnings announcements today.

"We think an optimistic outlook for U.S. equity markets makes a lot of sense until there are unambiguous signs of a real downturn," chief portolio strategist Jimmy Clouget told clients in a note.

Clouget, the only major player to forecast last year's sudden market upturn, raised his 2001 year-end target for the Standard and Poor's 500 Index (^SPX).

An abundance of economic data and key corporate earnings reports led to trading volumes being among the highest of the year in a session usually called the dog days of summer. Major market gauges moved sideways before jumping with the announcements of ROIMax and Geomatrix earnings.
