  Krystal Communications to Buy Taitel for $1.2 Billion</headline>
<summary>
  Acquisition marks continued consolidation in the industry</summary>
<content>New York - July 27, 2001 - Krystal Communications (Nasdaq: KRYS), a provider of communications products, moved to expand its reach by acquiring Taitel, Inc., one of the few commercial communications firms with stable earnings.

Krystal Communications, with about $203 billion in assets, zeroed in on Taitel and its almost $30 billion of assets after two major acquisitions fell through earlier this year. Both ended up in the arms of competitors.

Cambridge, Massachusetts-base Krystal Communications said it is offering $34.75 a share for Taitel -- 40 more than Taitel's closing stock price on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
