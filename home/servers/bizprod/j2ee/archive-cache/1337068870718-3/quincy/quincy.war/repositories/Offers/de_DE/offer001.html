<i>The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy</i>, Thomas J. Stanley
 and William D. Danko, 1996.<p>

 When most people think of millionaires, they picture fancy cars and cavernous mansions,
 but this book shows that our image of the wealthy doesn't always match reality. The authors
 interviewed people with net worths of more than $1 million and found that getting there takes
 sacrifice, discipline, and hard work. In fact, most millionaires continue to live beneath their
 means.<p>

 mystery out of money, Treasury bills, commodities, indexes, stocks, options, bonds, mutual
 funds, and more. If you've ever wanted to know more about any of these terms -- but were
 afraid to ask -- this book will provide answers. There's plenty of information and charts inside,
 including topics such as how to read the newspaper stock listings and how to translate
 financial jargon.<p>

 <i>The Real Life Investing Guide</i>, Kenan Pollack and Eric Heighberger, 1997.<p>

 Saving and investing doesn't mean you have to give up your life. The Real Life Investing

 that a young person can save on a small salary, real stories from other novice investors
 show that anyone can do it as long as he or she starts early enough.<p>

 learn all you can, be as aggressive as possible, and never touch your money until
 retirement.<p>
