For seven years running, the <A HREF="/QuincyFunds/en/fund.jsp?ElementId=/repositories/Funds/en_US/overseas.xml">Quincy Overseas Fund</a> has received 4 or 5 star ratings from Morningstar.  According to Morningstar, this is the first time in their history that the same fund has managed such stellar performance for such an extended period.  Of course, as a saavy investor, you know that past success does not guarantee future earnings.  However, we can say with confidence that the same management team that has charted the fund through turbulent financial waters remains on board, and remains committed to producing fantastic results in the years ahead.

Fund manager Walter Wall Carpiting's most recent report, Financial Wonderlust, has raised our expectations here at Quincy Funds even higher.  Back by an in depth investigation of the global financial currents, Walter's insightful musings on the future of current political unrest signaling potential returns beyond reasonable expectations certainly gives one great hope for the future.
