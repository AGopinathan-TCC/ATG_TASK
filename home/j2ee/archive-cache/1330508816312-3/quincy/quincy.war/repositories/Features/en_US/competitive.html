Check out the following information provided by Quincy's Center for Investment Research regarding the Quincy 
Growth Fund. This competitive analysis provides conclusive evidence that our fund will make your investors 
satisfied customers.<p>

For the twelve month period ended 3/31/99, the Quincy Growth Fund outperformed the Russell MidCap Growth Index 
by nearly 40 percentage points. (Note: the fund's benchmark changed from the Russell 2000 Index to the Russell 
MidCap Growth Index effective 2/1/99). The largest contributor to outperformance was exceptional stock selection 
within the overweight technology sector, as the fund capitalized on soaring Internet interest. Also aiding in 
performance was the fund's healthcare holdings that were focused on higher growth biotechnology and medical 
device companies.<p>

During the second quarter of 1998, the most significant contributors to the fund's outperformance relative to the 
Russell 2000 Index were individual holdings in technology and health care stocks. Investments in software (ATG 
and Pushead Software) and Internet (AOK and Yeehaw) stocks were excellent performers. In health care, shares of 
medical distributors (Hyde Corp.) and medical technology (Frankenstein & Co.) companies provided good returns. 
The main detractor from performance was the fund's overweighted allocation to weak performing health care 
stocks and underweighted exposure to strong finance stocks.<p>

The third quarter of 1998 was marked by turmoil throughout the financial markets. Overweightings versus the 
Russell 2000 Index in technology, health care, and retailing sectors all proved beneficial for performance. 
Technology contributors were spread broadly among personal computer, software, networking, and Internet stocks. 
Drug retailer Druggie Corp. was a top contributor on the strength of strong sales comparisons and the smooth 
integration of an acquisition, while health products distributor Hyde Corp. advanced strongly on earnings 
and sales growth that exceeded Wall Street expectations.<p>

During the fourth quarter, the fund significantly outperformed the Russell 2000 Index. The fund's overweight 
position in technology contributed positively, while disappointing performance from select health care 
companies was the largest detractor relative to the Russell MidCap Growth Index.<p>

The fund substantially outperformed the Russell MidCap Growth Index in the first quarter of 1999, aided 
primarily by exceptional stock picking in the technology sector, particularly from holdings with direct 
Internet exposure. Performance was further enhanced by strong returns from the fund's healthcare positions, 
where the fund remained focused on biotechnology companies. Detracting from performance were disappointing 
returns from select retail stocks and an underweighting in finance.
