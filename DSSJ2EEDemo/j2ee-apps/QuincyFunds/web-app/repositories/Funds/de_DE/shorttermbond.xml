  <objective>Quincy Short-Term Bond Fund seeks a high level of current
  income, with minimum fluctuation in principal value and an emphasis on
  liquidity.</objective>

  <strategy>The Fund invests primarily in short- and intermediate-term debt
  obligations issued by corporations, as well as by the U.S. government and
  its agencies; these shorter-term bonds tend to fluctuate less in value
  than longer-term, higher-yielding obligations. The Fund maintains a
  dollar-weighted average maturity of three years or less.
