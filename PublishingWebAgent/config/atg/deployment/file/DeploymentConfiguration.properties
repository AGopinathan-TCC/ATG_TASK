# source-side configurations

#
# Address and port on the client (source) side.  Used for multi-home
# machines or to control the client-side port.
#

#clientAddr=<IP address>
#clientPort=<port>

#
# Maximum file size held in memory on the source side.  1M by default.
# 0 or lower indicates no maximum
#

#maxSizeHeldInMemory=1000000

#
# Indicates what compression handler to use in the case where the file
# size exceeds the minSizeForCompression.  0 means never compress.  Must
# map to something in the compressionHandlerMap.  Default 0.
#

#defaultCompressionCode=0

#
# Minimum file size at which to compress.  0 indicates always compress.
# Default 100K.
#

#minSizeForCompression=100000

#
# File size, above which, the file will never be held in memory, even in
# compressed form.  Slows down performance by forcing the compression to
# occur twice.  Default 10M
#

#compressionMemoryThreshold=10000000

#
# Causes the file deployment to preserve timestamps from the source system.
# Default false.
#

#preserveFileTimestamps=false

#
# Turns off the feature that synchronizes the staging directory using the
# live directory as a source on the second apply phase of a switched deployment.
# Instead, files will be re-deployed.
#

#noCopyLiveToStaging=false

#
# Whether to trust the file size as reported in the file_size or similar 
# column of the Content Administration database.
#

#distrustFileSize=false

#
# Turns off the feature that checks a file by size and checksum, and 
# does not bother deploying it if it is identical
#

#noVerificationByChecksum=false

##############################
#
# configurations used by both the source and target side
#

#
# Maximum string size sent across the protocol.  8K by default.
#

#maximumStringLength=8000

#
# Maximum file size sent across the protocol.  2G by default.
#

#maximumFileSize=2000000000

#
# Buffer size used for output buffering on both sides.  Default 10K
#

#bufferSize=10000

#
# Compression handler map.  This maps integers to components that implement
# the CompressionHandler interface for streaming compression and decompression
# 0 indicates no compression and may not be mapped.  By default, no compression 
# handlers are enabled.
#

#compressionHandlerMap=1=<component path to CompressionHandler>

##############################
#
# target-side configurations
#

#
# When set to true, the target only performs online deployments.  In other
# words, the target will not deploy to the staging data store of a 
# SwitchableLocalFileSystem.  Default false.
#

#deployOnlineOnly=false

#
# Enables strict file management.  In this mode, adds will not be converted to 
# updates if the file exists, updates will not be converted to adds if the file
# does not exist, and deletes will check that the file exists.  Default false.
#

#strictFileOperations=false

#
# Turns off file size verification after an add or update.  Default false
#

#noFileSizeVerification=false

#
# Turns off checksum verification after an add or update.  Default false
#

#noChecksumAfterCopy=false

#
# Owner management.  ownerStrategy (RESOLVE_ERROR by default) can be set to
# one of RESOLVE_ERROR, RESOLVE_CLOBBER, RESOLVE_NO_CLOBBER, or RESOLVE_SPECIFIC.
# RESOLVE_ERROR throws an error in the event of any conflict, RESOLVE_CLOBBER 
# always overwrites in the event of conflicts, RESOLVE_NO_CLOBBER never overwrites,
# and RESOLVE_SPECIFIC uses the ownerSpecificWinnerId as the winner of any conflict.
# The last three never throw an error, but will print a warning if ownerWarning
# is true or unset.
#

#ownerStrategy=RESOLVE_ERROR
#ownerWarning=true
#ownerSpecificWinnerId=<put cluster id here>
