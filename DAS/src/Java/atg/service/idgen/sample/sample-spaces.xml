<id-spaces>
  <!-- here is a complete example using all attributes -->
  <id-space name="full_example"
            seed="1"
            batch-size="1000000"
            prefix="pre"
            suffix="post"
  />

  <!-- generally all you need to set are these properties -->
  <id-space name="vanilla" seed="1" batch-size="100000"/>

  <!-- ATG recommends using very large batch sizes for most objects As
       ids are Java longs (64 bit ints), you won't run out of ids for
       millions of years even with a batch size of 1 million and 1000
       Dynamo restarts every day:

       java_long = 9223372036854775807
       batch_size = 1000000
       restarts = 1000 
       daily_burn = batch_size * restarts
       yearly_burn = daily_burn * 365.25
       years_left = java_long / yearly_burn

       years_left /* => about 25 million years!! */

       BTW, the above is a legal script you can run through the POSIX
       tool "bc".

       Nevertheless, some sites prefer to see small ids for whatever
       reason, so here is an example of a small batch size with
       reasonable performance
  -->
  <id-space name="foo" seed="1" batch-size="1000"/>

  <!-- you can force ids to never have gaps this way, but every time
       you generate an id it will require an extra DB request so this is
       not generally recommended unless you use this id space very very
       infrequently.
  -->
  <id-space name="costly_id_space" seed="0" batch-size="1" />

</id-spaces>
