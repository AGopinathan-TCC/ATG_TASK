#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This logger logs deployments as items of type deploymentLog in the
# publishing repository. If the column mappings for this service are
# changed or if it is disabled then the "Deployment History" feature
# of Publishing may not work as expected.

# Deployment events occur at a very low frequency: less than one per
# hour typically. Ten per hour would be an unusually high
# number. Given this usage it is best to flush each event to the DB
# immediately since the performance impact is negligible and it allows
# viewers of the history to see the data quickly. For the same reason
# no data collection queue is interposed here.
# 
# There should in general be no reason to change the following
# settings, however advanced users familiar with the data collection
# facility and Publishing may do so if needed.
#
# If you do change the settings below, please let us know
# (support@atg.com) so that we can incorporate any generally useful
# changes into future versions of our products.
