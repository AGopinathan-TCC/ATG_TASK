  Krystal Communications enables ROIMax wireless channel</summary>
<content>July 24, 2001 - ROIMax, Inc. (Nasdaq: ROI) is planning to deploy its employee portal on the Krystal Communications technology.

ROIMax already has a single channel employee portal functioning today. But starting in the fourth quarter, they will be expanding connectivity possibilities to allow for employees to connect via their wireless devices such as cellular phones and handhelds.

ROIMax chief officer Jonathan Zet said the Cambridge, Mass., company is extending its reach while at the same time giving employees greater flexibility.

"We know that quite a few of our employees, particularly in larger urban areas, leverage wireless devices regularly," Zet said.

"Having more options will also prove cost-effective for the company," he said.

Zet said wireless technology has matured over the past 3 years to a point where it has become a wide-spread, household technology.

"So now this allows everybody to connect with the workplace on their own schedule as they need," Zet said.

Today's announcement will also help ROIMax as it rolls out enhanced wireless applications later this year. Zet said the applications will continue to focus on such areas as relationship management and retention.
