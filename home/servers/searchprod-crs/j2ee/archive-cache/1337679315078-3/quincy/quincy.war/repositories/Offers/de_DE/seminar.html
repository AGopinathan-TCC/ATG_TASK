Quincy Funds is happy to announce a special "Relax - It's Only Money" seminar in your area.  This seminar will be hosted by one of the nation's leading experts in financial therapy, Dr. I.M. Loated.  In addition to Dr. Loated's insightful lecture on the role worry can play in shaping investment decisions, we will also have one our leading fund managers on hand, Lotta D. Sissions.  She will discuss the strategies used by fund managers, and how these same strategies can be applied when making personal investment decisions.  We are very excited about being able to make this offer to Quincy Funds investors in your area and hope that you are able to attend.
