# Nucleus configuration for a live site.
#

#
# Check for changed .properties files.  For live sites where
# .properties files are not being modified, this should be set to -1 for
# the maximum performance (we'll never check for new .properties files).
#
# A value of 0 means always check.
#
# Note that .properties files are only checked when a new component is
# created.  For request scoped components this happens on each request.
# For globally scoped components, you have to restart nucleus to pick
# up the changes. 
#
configurationCheckMilliseconds=-1


#
# Whether or not we check the case of property file names against the
# canonical case used by the OS. On Unix this configuration is ignored.
# On NT it is important that this be set to false in a live system
# for maximum performance
checkFileNameCase=false

#
# Flag determining whether or not Nucleus registers a shutdown hook for
# a clean shutdown of the application.  
#
registerNucleusShutdownHook=true

#
# Disable the reloadable components feature.
# It may have undesireable side effects in a non-development machine
