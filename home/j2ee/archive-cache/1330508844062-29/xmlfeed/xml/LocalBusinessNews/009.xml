  Techs Rally as House Ups Chip Stocks</headline>

  NASDAQ Composite Index rises with upgrades of chip stocks</summary>
<content>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks hugged session highs in late morning trade on Wednesday, led by marquee high-tech names, after a bullish call from a Wall Street house on computer chipmakers.

``Whether or not we are at the bottom today I don't know but we are going to be pretty close,'' said Howard Maverick, portfolio manager at the $1 billion Fund.

Investors again shrugged off other economic news, as one report showed that the U.S. manufacturing sector was still slowing and appeared to lack drivers to stimulate recovery.

The tech-laced Nasdaq Composite Index (^IXIC) advanced 39.32 points, or 1.94 percent, led by Big Techs.

The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average (^DJI) rose 63.11 points, or 0.6 percent, and the broader Standard and Poor's 500 Index (^SPX) added 9.49 points, or 0.78 percent.

The House, noting the worst may be over for the chip companies, raised its opinion on the global semiconductor sector and upgraded the brokerage's recommendations on 12 stocks worldwide. Industry fundamentals suggest global demand had hit a trough and supply was stabilizing after strong growth, it said.

``I think the (year-on-year earnings) comparisons over this summer in semiconductors are probably going to be the worst ones in this cycle,''Maverick said. ``After August, the comparisons are still going to be bad but less bad and then they will turn positive next year for sure.''

The recovery will also be fueled by the lower interest rates after a spate of cuts this year by the Federal Reserve as well as the inventory corrections taking place, he said.
