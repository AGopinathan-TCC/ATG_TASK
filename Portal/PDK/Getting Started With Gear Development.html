<h1>Getting Started With Gear Development</h1>
<h6>&copy; 2002 ATG<br>
</h6>
The quickest way to learn how to write your own gears is to look at the supplied
gears. &nbsp;As a quick starting point, a skeleton of a gear has been provided
in the PDK/starter-template directory. &nbsp;It includes example pages for
each different gear mode, an associated gear manifest and the files needed
for packaging it into a WAR, EAR or DAR file.<br>
<br>
For more detailed developer documentation, please see the Portal Developer's
Guide in the ATG 6 Portal documentation.<br>
<h2>Deciding What Gear Modes You Need</h2>
The first task in developing a gear is to decide what gear modes you want
to support. &nbsp;You will definitely want a "content" mode, since your gear
won't be displayable without one. &nbsp;You will usually want a "userConfig"
mode so users can customize the gear for themselves. &nbsp;The "instanceConfig"
mode is intended for configuration that is common for all users of a gear.
&nbsp;The last major mode is "installConfig" which is intended for configuration
that is technical or complex in nature, such as setting up connections to
a back-end service such as a Repository or database.<br>
<br>
Each gear mode can have two display modes, "shared" and "full". &nbsp;"Shared"
mode is used when the gear is on a page with other gears, and "full" is used
when the gear gets the full page to itself. &nbsp;Generally a gear will have
"shared" and "full" display modes for the "content" gear mode, and the other
gear modes will only have a "full" display mode.<br>
<br>
A mode will look something like this in the manifest for your gear:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;gear-mode name="content"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;display-modes&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;display-mode name="shared"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &lt;device-output name="html"&gt;/html/sharedMode.jsp&lt;/device-output&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/display-mode&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;display-mode name="full"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &lt;device-output name="html"&gt;/html/fullMode.jsp&lt;/device-output&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/display-mode&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/display-modes&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;/gear-mode&gt;</pre>
<h2>Building Your Gear</h2>
As with most other Java development nowadays, "ant" is the tool of choice.
&nbsp;You can get ant from <a
 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html</a>.
&nbsp;The build.xml supplied with the starter-template gear has been tested
with ant 1.4.1. &nbsp;To build starter-template, change to the directory containing
the build.xml file and type "ant". &nbsp;Ant will then run the default target
in the buildfile. &nbsp;The default target is "build", which builds but does
not install the gear. &nbsp;If you want to install the gear you can use "install"
(installs the gear, building it if necessary) or "all" (rebuilds the gear
and the installs it).<br>
<br>
<h2>Installing Your Gear</h2>
Installing a gear is a two-part process. &nbsp;First you have to deploy it
to your app server. &nbsp;Second, you have to upload the gear's manifest so
the Portal knows what to do with it. &nbsp;On DAS you will need to remember
to add the new gear's module to the "-m" option you use to startDynamo. &nbsp;There
is an example gear manifest in PDK/starter-template/starter-template-manifest.xml.<br>
<h2>Creating URLs to Get to Different Modes</h2>
A common task you will have in writing your gear is to create URLs to switch
from one mode to another. &nbsp;To do this you will use the core:createUrl
tag and set the appropriate parameters to make the framework change modes.
&nbsp;An example of this is:
<pre><br>&lt;core:CreateUrl id="fullGearUrl" url="&lt;%= pafEnv.getOriginalRequestURI() %&gt;"&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;core:UrlParam param="paf_dm" value="full"/&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;core:UrlParam param="paf_gear_id" value="&lt;%= pafEnv.getGear().getId() %&gt;"/&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="&lt;%= fullGearUrl.getNewUrl() %&gt;"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/core:CreateUrl&gt;</pre>
This will take the URL of the current portal page (getOriginalRequestURI())
and switch to the "full" display mode (paf_dm=full) of the current gear (paf_gear_id=&lt;%=
pafEnv.getGear().getId() %&gt;). &nbsp;The gear's ID is its unique identifier
in the Portal system. &nbsp;If you want to have multiple pages in a gear
mode you just need to use a "switching page" for your gear mode that uses
a UrlParam you specify to choose which page to jsp:include for display. &nbsp;See
discussionFull.jsp in the Discussion gear for an example of a switching page.<br>
<br>
<h2>Using Color Palettes</h2>
To make your gear respect the colors of the community's chosen color palette,
you just need to use the ColorPalette object you can get from the Page object.
&nbsp;Once you have the gear environment<br>
<br>
<pre>&lt;paf:InitializeGearEnvironment id="pafEnv"&gt;</pre>
<br>
you can get the color Strings you need from the ColorPalette object.<br>
<br>
<pre>&lt;%<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; atg.portal.framework.ColorPalette cp = pafEnv.getPage().getColorPalette();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; String titleBGColor = cp.getHighlightBackgroundColor();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; String titleTextColor = cp.getHighlightTextColor();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; String gearBGColor = cp.getGearBackgroundColor();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; String gearTextColor = cp.getGearTextColor();<br>%&gt;</pre>
<br>
These Strings are the hexadecimal colors you need for your HTML code.<br>
<h2>Font Style Guide</h2>
To make it easy for gears to use the same fonts as other gears, Portal provides
a stylesheet with common font types. &nbsp;The top level page template includes
the stylesheet, so it will always be available to gears. Gears should try
to restrict themselves to using only these types or subclasses so that the
gear will have a common look to the other gears in the portal.<br>
<pre>  <br> body { font-family:verdana,arial,geneva,helvetica,san-serif ; }  <br> font { font-family:verdana,arial,geneva,helvetica,san-serif ; }<br>  <br> a              { text-decoration:none }  <br> a.gear_nav     { text-transform:lowercase }  <br> a.gear_content { text-decoration:none }  <br><br> .smaller {font-size:8pt; }  <br> .small   {font-size:10pt; }  <br> .medium  {font-size:11pt; }  <br> .large   {font-size:13pt; }  <br> .larger  {font-size:17pt; }  <br>  <br> .smaller_bold {font-size:8pt; font-weight:700 }  <br> .small_bold   {font-size:10pt; font-weight:700 }  <br> .medium_bold  {font-size:11pt; font-weight:700 }  <br> .large_bold   {font-size:13pt; font-weight:700 }  <br> .larger_bold  {font-size:17pt; font-weight:700 }<br><br></pre>
