This directory contains a datasource configuration for use with the MySQL 
database that ships with ATG. In order to run the ATG demos on JBoss using 
the MySQL database you will need to copy this file to the "deploy" directory 
of the whichever server directory contains the BigEar formatted applications 
you wish to run under JBoss.

For example, if your BigEar application was located in <JBOSS_HOME>/server/
default/deploy you would need to make sure a copy of this file was in the 
same directory.
