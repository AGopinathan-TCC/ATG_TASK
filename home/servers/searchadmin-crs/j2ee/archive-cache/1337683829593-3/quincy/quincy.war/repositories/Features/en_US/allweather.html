Here are some things that you should consider when you build your portfolio with Quincy.<p>

How Much Diversification Is Enough?<p>
 
We've all been told that diversification is a good thing. It spreads — and thereby lowers — risk without 
necessarily sacrificing return potential. But if you're building a portfolio of stocks, how diversified 
should you be?<p>
 
Too much of even a good thing may be counterproductive. Imagine a personal portfolio containing hundreds of 
stocks — it would be unwieldy, inflexible and difficult to shift meaningfully. And it would probably be 
costly, potentially requiring hundreds of commissions to buy and sell it.<p>
 
On the other hand, owning too few stocks can leave you dangerously undiversified. One plunging stock in a 
small portfolio can drop the overall return substantially.<p>
 
How many stocks should you hold?<p>
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that mutual funds own at least 20 different securities, so a 
case can be made that 20 is a logical minimum for an individual portfolio as well. But if 20 is the minimum, 
what's the maximum? A well-regarded study conducted by Lawrence Fischer and James Lorie tracked the risk of 
investing in stocks against the number of stocks in a portfolio.1 The study found that risk drops 
dramatically as additional stocks are added to a portfolio, until it reaches the 20-stock level. After this 
level is reached, the inclusion of additional stocks in a portfolio reduces risk only slightly.<p>
 
Allocating your stock portfolio:<p>
 
Once you've decided how many stocks you want to own, the next step is to address how you will allocate your 
investments among those stocks and among different industry groups. The precise answer will depend on your 
particular needs, objectives, time horizon and attitude toward risk, but here are some general rules of thumb: 

<ol>
<li>Consider spreading your portfolio among at least 12 different industry groups. 
<li>Invest no more than 10 percent of the portfolio in any one industry. 
<li>Invest no more than 5 percent of the portfolio in any one stock.
</ol><p>

The first two rules help lower sector risk — the risk that the portfolio will be damaged by adverse 
developments in one industry sector. By spreading risk among at least 12 sectors, and by keeping exposure to 
any one sector to 10 percent or less, a collapse of one industry sector should not hurt the portfolio unduly.<p> 
 
Industry sector volatility is a real concern. Take 1998 for example — a year that saw the S&P 500 rise over 
25 percent. Despite the market's overall gains, several sectors tumbled, including real estate (down 17 
percent) and oil services (down more than 50 percent).3 With no more than 10 percent in any one sector, 
even a 50 percent decline in a sector shouldn't reduce the portfolio value by more than 5 percent.<p>
 
The choice of sectors can affect the diversity of the portfolio. Some sectors tend to move out-of-sync with 
one another. Airlines and oil stocks, for instance, are well known for being negatively correlated. Airlines 
benefit from lower oil prices; oil stocks benefit from higher oil prices. Owning both sectors adds 
meaningfully to overall diversification. Oil stocks and oil service stocks are an example of two highly 
correlated sectors. Owning both will not offer substantial diversification benefits.<p>
 
As the markets move and sector percentages shift over time, you may want to regularly rebalance your sector 
weightings back to your original allocations. If a sector rises markedly in value, for instance, its 
representation in the portfolio may rise well above 10 percent, calling for a cutback in that sector to the 
10 percent level.<p>
 
The third rule of thumb (invest no more than 5 percent of the portfolio in any one stock) is designed to 
reduce specific risk — the risk that a development adverse to a particular company will hurt the portfolio. 
Keeping exposure to any one stock down to 5 percent or less will ensure that even if an individual stock 
tumbles 50 percent, it shouldn't decrease the overall portfolio value by more than 2.5 percent.<p> 
 
Spread the risk:<p>
 
Finally, spreading risk across company sizes, geographical regions and styles can enhance diversification 
even further. Since stocks of big companies and small companies don't always move in sync, owning both 
large-cap and small-cap stocks may enhance diversification. Adding foreign equities to a U.S.-only portfolio 
has also been shown to lower risk, since foreign stocks often tend to move out-of-step with domestic stocks.<p>
 
Diversifying by style — owning both growth and value stocks — may help further spread risk, because growth 
investing and value investing tend to move in independent cycles.<p>
 
However you decide to diversify your stock portfolio, be sure that the diversification plan you choose is in 
tune with your overall asset allocation strategy, investment goals, risk tolerance and time horizon. While 
building a diversified portfolio is more common sense than rocket science, it's still a good idea to review 
your diversification ideas with a professional financial advisor.<p>
