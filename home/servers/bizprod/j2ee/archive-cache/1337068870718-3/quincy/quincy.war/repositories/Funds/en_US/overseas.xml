  <objective>Managed for long-term growth of capital by investing in a
  diversified portfolio of foreign companies.</objective>

  <strategy>The investment objective of this Fund is long-term growth of capital. It is
a diversified fund that pursues its objective primarily through investments
in common stocks of issuers located outside the United States. The Fund has
the flexibility to invest on a worldwide basis in companies and other
organizations of any size, regardless of country of organization or place of
principal business activity. The Fund normally invests at least 65% of its
total assets in securities of issuers from at least five different
countries, excluding the United States. Although the Fund intends to invest
substantially all of its assets in issuers located outside the United
States, it may at times invest in U.S. issuers and it may at times invest
all of its assets in fewer than five countries or even a single country.
