The order approval gear is part of the effort to make the existing Commerce
functionality available as gears. Making the commerce functionality available
as gears will allow end users of B2C and B2B commerce sites to customize
the commerce contents of their sites. From the perspective of portal administrator,
community leader or end user, the commerce specific gears will behave exactly
like any other gear. The Order Approval gear will be made available to
a customer, if they buy both B2B Commerce set and Portals.

<h3>
<a NAME="intro" id="intro"></a><b>Introduction</b></h3>
This document describes the requirements for the order approval gear. The
order approval will be used to display orders that need to be approved
by a user. It may also be used to display orders that have already been
approved or rejected by the user. The order approval gear will rely on
the existing Commerce and Portal functionality to display order related
information to the user in a generic fashion. The order approval gear will
consist of five set of pages - shared view, full view, userconfig, installConfig
and instanceConfig view.
<br>&nbsp;

<b>Shared and Full view of the gear</b>
<br>The shared view of a gear is used when the gear is displayed in a page
along with other gears. The shared view of the order approvals gear will
contain the following information.
<p>a) List some of the recently placed orders that need to be approved
by the user who is logged in. Four fields of the order will be displayed
- Order number, date ordered, order total and buyer. For example -
<br>Order #&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date Ordered&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Order total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyer
<br>1231&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

ABC
<p>The user will also be able to configure the number of recent orders
that are shown in the shared view. If set to zero, the list of recently
placed orders will disappear. By default the five most recent orders that
need to be approved will be shown to the user. It should be noted here
that the state of the order is not displayed, as the state is always PENDING_APPROVAL.
Clicking on the order number will take the user to the order details page.
From the order details page, the user will be able to specify whether the
order needs to be approved or rejected.
<p>b) List the number of total orders that need to be approved. For example
- There are 9 approval requests. If there are no orders that need to be
approved, then an appropriate message will be displayed. The end user will
be able to configure whether she wants to see this information or not.
<p>c) Link to all the orders needing approvals. This will link to the full
view of the gear.
<p>d) Link to all the orders that have been already approved or rejected.
This will also link to the full view of the gear.
<p>If a user is not logged in, then the contents of the gear will not be
displayed. The layout template that includes this gear, will require the
user to login, before the gear can be displayed.
<p>The full view of the gear will be invoked when the user clicks on the
"Pending approval requests" or Resolved requests" link. A request parameter
(type) will be passed to the full view of the gear.
<p>a) The full view of the order will also show a list of orders like the
shared view. The full view will have these three pieces of information
--
<br>Order #&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date Ordered&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Order total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Approved
<br>b) Count of orders. For example - "Now viewing orders 1 - 10 out of
11"
<br>c) Link to the previous 10 or next 10 orders if necessary.
<p>Some things to note here are --
<br>a) The list of orders will have the following columns - Date of the
order, Order number (this will be a link to the order page), $ value of
the order, buyer, description and state. The description will contain the
1st item quantity concatenated with "-" followed by the quantity of the
item. The order number will have a link to the order page.
<br>b) By default the full view of the order approval gear will show 10
orders per page. The user will be able to set the number of orders per
page in the full page view.
<br>c) The total number of orders that are displayed will also be configurable
by the user. By default all the orders will be displayed to the user.
<br>d) There will be two differences in the the display of orders between
the approved orders and orders pending approval view.
<br>1. The first and the obvious one is the list of orders shown will be
different. They will have the state "PENDING_APPROVAL" or "APPROVED/REJECTED"
view depending upon the request parameter "approved".
<br>2. The link to the order page will also be different. For the approved
list of orders, the link to the order page will typically point to the
basic order details page of a Commerce application. This order details
page will not be part of the gear. For the orders pending approval display
of the full view, the order details page besides giving the details of
order, will also have Approve and Reject buttons at the bottom. This page
will be part of the gear.
<p><b>Rest of the Approval process</b>
<br>When viewing list of orders pending approval in full view of the gear,
the user will be able to invoke the rest of the order approval process
by clicking on any order number. The community leader will have the option
to either use the approval process included within this gear, or to use
the approval process available as part of a commerce application. If using
the approval process of a commerce application, the admin will be able
to specify the URL of the order page that needs to be used for the approval
process. The rest of the approval process is modeled on the existing Motorprise
approval process.
<p>If the Portal Administrator decides to use the approval process of the
gear, then the link from the order number in full view will go to the order
details page of this gear. The order details page will have the following
sections -
<br>a) Order number. The order number will be displayed at the top.
<br>b) Basic order information. This section will include the following
information - the date the order was placed, the order state, the buyer's
name, email and organization. The information displayed in this section
will be optional. The Community leader will be able to disable this display
of information on this page.
<br>c) Billing information. This section will include the following information
for each of the payment method - Payment method, amount, billing address
and cost center. The information displayed in this section will be optional.
The Community leader will be able to disable this display of information
on this page.
<br>d) Shipping information. This section will include the following information
for each of the shipping method - Shipping address, shipping method, items
and the cost for this shipping group. The items will be a list of items
each of which will have - Quantity, part number, name and price. The cost
will include the subtotal for this shipping group and the shipping cost.
The information displayed in this section will be optional. The Community
leader will be able to disable this display of information on this page.
<br>e) The total cost of the order and the sales tax will be displayed
at the bottom.
<br>f) Also at the bottom of the Orders Pending Approval page, there will
be links to approve or reject the order. Clicking on these links will bring
the appropriate pages.
<p>The sections on order information, billing information, and shipping
information will be optional, and may be removed by the community leader.
However all the information will be shown by default.
<p>The Approve Order page will include three sections of information -
<br>a) Basic information on the order. This will include the Order number,
the order placed date, and the buyer name. This section will be optional,
and&nbsp; the community leader will be able to remove this section of the
page.
<br>b) Message text box. This will allow the Approver to store any message
related to the order and why it is being approved. This section will be
optional, and&nbsp; the community leader will be able to remove this section
of the page.
<br>c) Approve order and Cancel buttons.
<p>Clicking on the Approve order button will actually approve the order.
It will bring the approval confirmation page that will have the order number,
order submitted date, buyer and the message. There will be a link from
this page that will take the user back to the Full view of the page.
<p>The Reject Order page will be similar to the Reject order page. It will
include three sections of information -
<br>a) Basic information on the order. This will include the Order number,
the order placed date, and the buyer name. This section will be optional,
and&nbsp; the community leader will be able to remove this section of the
page.
<br>b) Message text box. This will allow the Approver to store any message
related to the order and why it is being rejected. This section will be
optional, and&nbsp; the community leader will be able to remove this section
of the page.
<br>c) Reject order and Cancel buttons.
<br>Clicking on the Reject order button will actually reject the order.
It will bring the rejection confirmation page that will have the order
number, order submitted date, buyer and the message. There will be a link
from this page that will take the user back to the Full view of the page.
<p>This is a list of contents pages that will be part of the order approval
gear.
<ol>
<li>
Shared view of the gear</li>

<li>
Full view of the gear. This will display either the orders pending approval
or orders approved.</li>

<li>
The order details page with the Approve or Reject buttons.</li>

<li>
The Approve order page</li>

<li>
Approval confirmation page</li>

<li>
The Reject order page</li>

<li>
The Reject confirmation page</li>
</ol>
There will not be any WML pages in this gear.
<p><b>UserConfig, InstanceConfig and InstallConfig pages</b>
<br>There are four administration modes that Portals support - installConfig,
instanceConfig, initialConfig and userConfig. installConfig mode is used
by the Portal administrator when a gear manifest file is loaded to create
a gear definition. initialConfig is invoked when a community leader creates
a gear instance for a community from the gear definition. instanceConfig
mode is invoked, when a community leader tries to configure a pre-existing
gear instance. The userConfig mode is available to end users. This allows
end users to configure user specific parameters. Each gear may or may not
define these configuration modes.
<p>The Order Approvals gear will have pages defined for three modes - instanceConfig,
installConfig and userConfig.
<p>The userConfig page will have the following fields to be configured
by the user.
<ul>
<li>
Number of orders displayed on the shared view of the page. By default the
five most recent orders that need to be approved will be displayed to the
user.</li>

<li>
Display the total number of orders that need to be approved in the shared
page. The end user will be able to configure whether she wants to see this
information or not. By default this information will be displayed.</li>

<li>
Number of orders per page in the full view of the page. The default will
be 10 orders per page.</li>

<li>
Total number of orders that need to be displayed in the full view. By default
all the orders will be displayed. A user may specify that she does not
want to see all the orders, and see only a subset of orders (say 100).</li>
</ul>
InstanceConfig page will have the following fields to be configured by
the community leader.
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Display the basic order information in the Order details page of the approval
process. The default will be true. That is by default the basic information
will be displayed.</li>

<li>
Display the Billing information in the Order details page of the approval
process. The default will be true. That is by default the billing information
will be displayed.</li>

<li>
Display the Shipping information in the Order details page of the approval
process. The default will be true. That is by default the shipping information
will be displayed.</li>

<li>
Display the basic order information on the Approve order page. The default
will be true. That is by default the basic order information will be displayed.</li>

<li>
Display the message text box on the Approve order page. The default will
be true. That is by default the message text box will be displayed.</li>

<li>
Display the basic order information on the Reject order page. The default
will be true. That is by default the basic order information will be displayed.</li>

<li>
Display the message text box on the Reject order page. The default will
be true. That is by default the message text box will be displayed.</li>
</ul>
All the options of instanceConfog are relevant only if "Use the Order Approval
process of the gear" is set to true, i.e. if the Approval procedure provided
by the gear is being used.
<p>InstallConfig page will have the following fields to be configured by
the user
<ul>
<li>
Use the Order Approval process of the gear. The default will be true. i.e.
by default the order approval process of the gear will be used.</li>

<li>
The order page URL from the approved orders display of the full view. This
will typically link to the order details page of the commerce application.</li>

<li>
The order page URL from the pending approval orders display of the full
view and the shared view. This will be used if the option "Use the Order
Approval process of the gear" is set to false. So if the Portal Administrator
wants to use the approval process provided in a Commerce application instead
of the approval process provided in the gear, than the URL provided in
here will be used to link from the order number on the Shared view and
the Pending approval display of the full view.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="arch" id="arch"></a><b>Architecture</b></h3>
One of the main approaches of the Commerce gear development is to reuse
the existing functionality available in Commerce and B2BCommerce modules
as far as possible. The order approval gear will also reuse all the existing
components available in B2BCommerce for the Order Approval procedure.
<p>The gear configuration pages will use the GearConfigFormHandler. The
InitializeGearEnvironment tag of PAF tag library will be used to read the
instance and userConfig parameters.
<p>The ApprovalRequiredDroplet droplet will be used in the shared view
and full view to display the orders that need to be approved. To display
the orders that have been approved or rejected by the user, a new component
ApprovedOrdersDroplet that will use the same class atg.commerce.approval.ApprovalRequiredDroplet,
will be created. This component will set the orderStatesRequiringApproval
property to
<br>"APPROVED,REJECTED,SUBMITTED,NO_PENDING_ACTION" .
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="impl" id="impl"></a><b>Implementation</b>
<ol>The Order Approval gear will be a sub module within the CommerceGears
module - CommerceGears.OrderApproval. This module will have portal.paf
and B2BCommerce as dependent modules. The Order Approval code will be part
of the B2BCommerce code at (//product/B2BCommerce/main/projects/OrderApprovalGear).
<p>A request parameter (type) will be passed to the full view of the gear.
The top level page of the full view will just have a switch statement based
on the value of the "approved" parameter. It will include two different
page fragments based on the type parameter - one to display approved orders
and the other to display orders pending approval. The pages in the order
approval flow will need to carry this parameter. After the user has approved
or rejected an order, the user will be redirected to the full view of the
gear with type parameter set appropriately.
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<h3>

<h3>
Alert Message</h3>
An alert messages will be generated when an order is approved or rejected.
This will use the new framework of alerts that uses JMS messages that is
being built for Copper.
<h3>
Integrations</h3>
The gear will use the existing functionality available in the B2BCommerce,
Commerce and Portals. It will be used in the Ecovida demo. Eventually a
subset of Motorprise demo will be written using the Commerce gears. At
that time this gear will be used to build a portals version of Motorprise.
<h3>
Existing Components &amp; Taglibs Used</h3>
The functionality of the pages of this gear is already available in Motorprise.
So the approval process will use the standard B2CCommece components. Also
the gear pages will use the following tag libraries -
<ol>
<li>
DSP tag library to access Dynamo's droplets and nucleus components</li>

<li>
Core tag library to perform basic tasks like switch, if etc.</li>

<li>
paf tag library to access the functionality of Portal application framework</li>

<li>
jakarta-i18n tag library to make all the JSP pages internationalized.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
New Components &amp; Taglibs Created for this gear</h3>
No tag library will be written for this gear. The only new component will
be ApprovedOrdersDroplet which is explained above.</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="install" id="install"></a>Installation, Configuration, Administration
and Diagnostics</h3>
The Gear manifest file will be one of the deliverables of the development
process. It will be present in the etc. directory. The Portal administrator
will be able to load the gear manifest file to create a gear definition
for the Order Approval gear.
<h3>
<a NAME="perf" id="perf"></a>Performance Goals</h3>
The Order Approval need to be able to display a large number of orders.
The user needs to be able to view a large number of orders without any
significant impact on performance.
<h3>
<a NAME="test" id="test"></a>Test Development</h3>
All the pages in the contents and the configuration of Order Approval gear
will be tested as part of unit testing on DAS and one more application
server.
<h3>
<a NAME="doc" id="doc"></a>Documentation Requirements</h3>
Besides the technical specifications (this) document, a brief user document
will also be written. These two documents combined will form the basis
of the formal documentation that will be written by the documentation group.
<h3>
<a NAME="extrn" id="extrn"></a>External Code</h3>
The gear will rely on the existing order approval functionality available
in the B2BCommerce module.
<h3>
<a NAME="inter" id="inter"></a>Internationalization</h3>
The order gear will be internationalized using the same style as all the
existing Portal gears using the Jakarta i18n library. Any text that is
displayed to the user will be written in a properties file and will be
printed using the &lt;i18n:message> tag.
<h3>
<a NAME="sec" id="sec"></a>Security</h3>
The code within the instanceConfig page will be included within a &lt;paf:CommunityLeaderCheck>
tag. This will ensure that only the community leader can access the page.
The code within all the content pages and userconfig page will be included
within the &lt;paf:RegisteredUserCheck> tag to ensure that only a registered
user can access the gear pages.
<p>Also all the contents pages will have a check to ensure that only users
that have permissions to approve orders are given access to the contents
pages.
