  <objective>Quincy High Yield Fund seeks high current income; long-term
  capital appreciation is a secondary goal.
  </objective>

  <strategy>The Fund invests primarily in bonds, other debt securities, and
  preferred stocks issued by corporations. Fund holdings focus primarily on
  obligations rated in the lower credit categories by established ratings
  services. Up to 25% of the Fund?s total assets may be invested in
  dollar-denominated foreign debt securities, which are subject to special
  risks, such as differences in securities regulation and accounting, as well as currency fluctuations.
