<summary>
  Comprehensive building blocks fuel investor optimism</summary>
<content>Tokyo. July 30, 2001 - Following his ruling party's resounding victory in the Upper-House elections, Koizumi announced a schedule for economic reforms. "I have been given a foundation for reform. I will release reform schedules in two steps. First in the summer, and the next one in the fall," he was quoted as saying.

Investors welcomed the news, hoping the reforms - which are expected to include fiscal austerity measures and steps to deal with banks' bad loans - will bring the country's economy roaring back.

By midday, the Nikkei Average was up 3.01 percent. The broader Topix added a percent.
