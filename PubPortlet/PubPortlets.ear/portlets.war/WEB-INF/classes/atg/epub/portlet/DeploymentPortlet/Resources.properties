#site_details_tabs.jspf
back-to-deployment-overview=back to deployment overview
details-intro-p1=The Details tab displays summary information about the target site's \
  current state and running deployments.
details-intro-p2=For the site, deployment processing can be halted and resumed. \
 In the case of an unrecoverable error, the site can be critically reset. \
 This action should be used cautiously, as a critical reset wipes out any \
 current deployment on the local server as well as the target site, \
 resetting both to an idle state.
details-intro-p3=The current deployment can be stopped, resumed, rolled back, or \
 canceled, depending on the state of the deployment. For a stopped or \
 failed deployment, selecting Resume re-attempts the deployment. For \
 deployments that have stopped or failed at a critical point, selecting \
 Roll Back attempts to undo the changes made to the site. Canceling the \
 deployment revokes the deployment approval for each project in the \
 deployment, notifying the workflow that no deployment will occur to this \
 site.

todo-intro-p1=The To Do tab displays the list of projects that have been approved for \
  deployment to this site but have not yet been scheduled for deployment.

todo-intro-p2=You can schedule individual projects for deployment or select multiple \
 projects to deploy together. The Reject Selected Projects option \
 revokes deployment approval for the specified project and notifies the \
 workflow that no deployment will occur to this site for the project. \
 Projects that have completed but were never deployed to this site \
 display here as Orphaned. You can deploy orphaned projects in the same \
 way as approved projects. Rejecting an orphaned project has no effect.

agents-intro-p1=The Agents tab lists all deployment agents configured for the current \
target site. This tab has two modes: Overview, Switchable Datastores
agents-intro-p2-1=Overview
agents-intro-p2-2=Provides general information about each agent that can help troubleshoot \
server problems. For example, you can compare agent snapshots to identify non-matching agents \
that might be responsible for blocking incremental deployments. 
agents-intro-p3-1=Switchable Datastores
agents-intro-p3-2=Lists the target datastores that each agent is configured to switch, \
and identifies which datastores are currently live.

plan-intro-p1=The Plan tab displays a list of pending deployments to this target site, \
 ordered by execution time.

plan-intro-p2-1=The first deployment shown is the next deployment to run. Both queued \
 and scheduled deployments are displayed in this list. Queued deployments \
 run in the order shown, whereas scheduled deployments are added to the \
 end of the queue when their deploy time is reached.

plan-intro-p2-2=The first deployment shown is the next deployment to run, queued deployments \
are run in the order shown.

plan-intro-p3-1=Canceling a deployment shown here revokes the deployment approval for \
 each project in the deployment, notifying the workflow that no \
 deployment will occur to this site.

plan-intro-p3-2=Canceling a deployment shown here removes the deployment from the queue and the \
 deployment will not occur to this site.

processes-intro-p1=The Projects tab displays a list of all the projects that have been \
 deployed to this target site.
processes-intro-p1-1=Rollback is allowed only to deployed and completed project.
processes-intro-p2=The first project in the list is the most recently deployed. Projects \
 whose workflow has not yet completed appear as Active and may not have \
 been permanently deployed yet.
processes-intro-p3=You can revert a target site to an earlier deployment state by selecting a \
project to roll back to. Rollback is not allowed to any active or completed \
project which was deployed prior to the last active deployed project. To \
rollback an active project, first rollback to that project and then use the \
project's workflow to revert it from the site.

 fixed by normal means.

#config_make_live.jsp
flagging-intro-text=After you create the new site, you must initialize it by deploying data \
 to it. However, if you used the database from the new site to create the \
 versioned database on the ATG Content Administration server, you need to \
 perform a full deployment to the new site only if the data has changed. \
 In this case, select Flag Agents Only when you initialize the new site \
 (this option appears if appropriate when you select 'Make changes live' or \
 the 'Create initial deployment' button in the Overview > Details tab). The \
 Flag Agents Only option updates agents only if the versioned data has \
 changed, which is faster than performing a full deployment.
