If you're someone who is yearning to escape from the woes of public transportation, then you've probably 
heard the horror stories about what a car will probably cost these days. This year, it took an average of 
$15,069 to get behind the wheel of an automobile, and as we all know these costs are escalating with 
each passing year.<p>
 
When you consider that this is just the sticker price for your new car, the picture gets a little frightening. 
And if you need more than one car, the cost can seem downright overwhelming. But with some smart planning, 
purchasing what you need in terms of automated transportation is an achievable goal. Here are a few tips.<p> 

Start saving right now:<p>
 
The cardinal rule of saving for a car is to start as soon as you possibly can — even before you learn to drive, 
if possible. But whether you are a teenager, or an adult, the time to start is now. The longer 
you wait, the harder it will be to meet your goals when it comes to saving for a car.<p>
 
Invest for the long term:<p>
 
Unless you are fewer than five months away from needing some wheels, treat saving for your car like a 
long-term goal. For most people, a long-term time horizon means they can consider more volatile investments, 
like stocks or stock mutual funds, which have the potential for higher returns. Less volatile investments, 
like bonds, have tended to underperform stocks over the long haul. 
 
It's also important that your investments grow faster than car costs. In 1998-1999, auto prices, registration 
fees, excise tax and auto insurance rose about 4 percent, but they have grown faster in the past. If the 
after-tax returns on your investment don't keep pace, you're losing ground. This need to generate higher 
returns again points toward considering stocks over bonds.<p>
 
A typical — and potentially effective — strategy is to invest aggressively when you are young, then gradually 
adjust your asset allocation toward less volatile investments as you near driving age.<p>
 
 
 
Where to put automobile savings:<p>
 
When it comes to choosing the type of account to use for your car fund, you have several choices, all 
of which have certain limitations.<p>

<li>IRA withdrawals. The new tax rules make it possible to withdraw money from an IRA to pay for auto 
expenses without incurring an IRS early-withdrawal penalty. Unfortunately, once you withdraw the money, you 
lose the benefit of tax-deferred growth and cut into your own retirement security.  
 
<li>Many people find that the best way to save more than $500 per year for a car is through an ordinary 
brokerage or mutual fund account held in their own names. While these accounts are not tax-deferred, if you 
buy and hold a portfolio of stocks or select mutual funds with low-turnover rates (such as index funds), the 
majority of your capital gains tax liability can be deferred until you sell your shares.
