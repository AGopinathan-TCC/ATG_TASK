  <objective>The Fund seeks high total return through a combination of capital
appreciation and current income.</objective>

  <strategy>The Quincy G&amp;I Fund places a heavier emphasis on growth while
  making current income a secondary objective. It targets stocks that fund
  management believes are cheaply priced relative to their true value. This
  focus is applied to large companies poised to implement positive change,
  such as restructuring measures, new products or distribution methods, and
  cost reductions. This fund has the flexibility to invest in more
  medium-size companies and holds fewer stocks in more concentrated positions.
