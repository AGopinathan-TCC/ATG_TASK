You should use this directory to store any changes that you need to make
to your Dynamo configuration.  Any values in .properties files stored 
under this directory will override values in Dynamo's default configuration.

The most commonly configured entries are stored in the file:

  localconfig/atg/dynamo/Configuration.properties

which is created when you install Dynamo. 

Dynamo's default configuration is stored in .properties files which are
stored in a single .jar file.  You can either view this configuration
information through Dynamo's Admin UI, the components window of the 
Dynamo Control Center, or by unjarring the .jar files.

See the chapter in the Dynamo Programmer's Guide on Nucleus for more information 
about setting values in .properties files.
